# Event creation app

## Overview

**Event Creation App** is a hands-on exercise focused on the fundamentals of mobile app development. Using React Native to create interfaces, Expo to simplify development and provide additional features, and TypeScript to add static typing to the code.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools installed before proceeding:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
- EXPO
- Emulator device to test the application

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yohmay/react-native

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

This will start the Expo Metro Bundler server. Open the app on the emulator or scan the QR code with Expo Go
